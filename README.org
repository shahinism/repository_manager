* Git Host Helper Scripts

This project will host a set of scripts, helping me to maintain my
personal project setting. The usual usecases are:

1. Change my main Git host, for acting like an #######, lack of
   feature, etc.
2. Create a Git backup repo for my active projects in batch.

  
* How to use?

Clone the repository. Then you have two options:

** Run Directly

#+begin_src bash
  # poetry run [SCRIPT] [ARGUMENTS] [--OPTIONS]
  poetry run togh --help
#+end_src
* Scripts

** Git Uploader

#+begin_src text
Usage: togh.py [OPTIONS] PATH

  This command will find all git repositories in a given path and upload them
  to GitHub. I needed to structure them based on the projects, so it uses my
  personal convention, where all repositories, are located in main project's
  root directory.

  The command will create the GitHub repository based on the convention (if it
  doesn't already exist).

  It'll upload all of the local branches, and tags.

  After processing is done, it'll create a `github_lock` file in the `.git`
  folder, to prevent reprocessing.

  To use it, you need to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. You can get
  it based on this documentation: https://bit.ly/3leBkHM

  Make sure you enable the following scopes:

  1. Repository: Read access to metadata. 2. Repository: Read and Write access
  to administration.

Options:
  --remote-name TEXT
  --lock-name TEXT
  --help              Show this message and exit.
